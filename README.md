# Data_Collection

The task is divided into two parts. 

In Part 1, the goal is to scrape the titles and preview text of news articles from the Mars News website. You should use Beautiful Soup to extract the text, store it in dictionaries with the keys "title" and "preview," and then save these dictionaries in a list. Optionally, you can export the data to a JSON file. 

In Part 2, the focus is on scraping and analyzing Mars weather data. You need to visit the Mars Temperature Data site, inspect the page to identify the relevant elements to scrape, and then analyze the information obtained.
